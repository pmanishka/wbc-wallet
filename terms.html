				10. The WBCRYP Services
				<div class="next-line">10.1. As described in more detail below, the Services, among other things, provide in-browser (or otherwise local) software that (a) generates and stores Virtual Currency Wallet Addresses and encrypted Private Keys (defined below), and (b) Facilitates the submission of Virtual Currency transaction data to the relevant Virtual Currency WBCRYP network without requiring you to download or install the associated Virtual Currency network software to your local device 10.2. Wallet Address and Private Key and Backup Phrase. When you create a Wallet, the Services generate and store a cryptographic private and public key pair that you may use to send and receive any supported Virtual Currency via the relevant Virtual Currency network. An encrypted backup of certain information associated with the Wallet is stored by the Services. The Private Key uniquely matches the Wallet Address and must be used in connection with the Wallet Address to authorize the transfer of Virtual Currency from that Wallet Address. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your Private Key and any backup phrase associated with your wallet. You must keep your Wallet Address, backup phrase and Private Key access information secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of Virtual Currency associated with the Wallet.</div>
				<div class="next-line">10.2. Wallet Address and Private Key and Backup Phrase. When you create a Wallet, the Services generate and store a cryptographic private and public key pair that you may use to send and receive any supported Virtual Currency via the relevant Virtual Currency network.

Therefore, we cannot assist you with Wallet password retrieval. Our Services provide you with tools to help you remember or recover your password, including by allowing you to set password hints, but the Services cannot generate a new password for your Wallet. You are solely responsible for remembering your Wallet password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any Wallet Addresses and Private Key pairs maintained in your Wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any Virtual Currency you have associated with such Wallet Addresses will become inaccessible if you do not have your Wallet password.</div>
				<div class="next-line">10.4. Transactions. In order to be completed, all proposed Virtual Currency transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the Virtual Currency public ledger associated with the relevant Virtual Currency network. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third-parties, which are not owned, controlled or operated by WBCRYP. Virtual Currency networks are operated by decentralized networks of independent third parties. WBCRYP has no control over any Virtual Currency network and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction details you submit via the Services will be confirmed via the relevant Virtual Currency network. You acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit via the Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Virtual Currency network used to process the transaction. </div>
				<div class="next-line">10.5. No Storage or Transmission of Virtual Currency. A Virtual Currency is an intangible, digital asset. They exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained in the underlying Virtual Currency network. The Services do not store, send or receive Virtual Currency.

				<div class="next-line">10.8. No Cancellations or Modifications. Once transaction details have been submitted to the Virtual Currency network via the Services, the Services cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction details.

			<div class="con-data">
				12. Miners Fees
				<div class="next-line">12.1. Overview of Virtual Currency Mining. A Virtual Currency network is a network of computers operated by individuals or entities known as "miners," who voluntarily participate in the process of confirming transactions on the network. These computers (known as “mining rigs”) compile a list or “block” of pending transactions, verify that each transaction in the block is valid and does not involve an attempt to double-spend coins, and attempt to complete a mathematical algorithm that determines whether the block may be added to the public ledger of confirmed blocks, called the "WBCRYP." Typically, miners receive: (i) an amount of Virtual Currency as a reward for any confirmed transaction, generated automatically via the Virtual Currency mining protocol; and (ii) Any fees voluntarily included within the block by the individuals who initiated the proposed transactions ("Miners Fees"). Since miners verify Virtual Currency transactions on a voluntary basis, it is customary to include a Miners Fee in order to provide an incentive to the miners to add a proposed transaction to the next block for confirmation via the Virtual Currency network.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="con-data">
				13. Default Miners Fee
				<div class="next-line">13.1. For Bitcoin, you may choose between three Miners Fee settings: (i) Default, (ii) High and (iii) Custom. For Ethereum, WBCRYP will determine a default Miners Fee. You accept and acknowledge that WBCRYP does not receive any Miners Fees in connection with providing the Services, and is not responsible for the speed at which your transactions may be verified by miners.</div>
