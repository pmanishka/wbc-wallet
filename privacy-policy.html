				Privacy is of utmost importance at the WBCRYP group of companies ("WBCRYP"). We recognize the significance of protecting information which is stored on our computers or is intended to be stored on our computers and which relates to an individual. The data we protect are the "Personal Data" which is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, sometimes called a data subject, and have made protecting privacy and the confidentiality of Personal Data a fundamental component of the way we do business. This Privacy Policy informs you of the ways we ensure privacy and the confidentiality of Personal Data. We are compliant with applicable privacy laws in the countries in which we operate. This policy describes the information we gather, how we may use those Personal Data and the circumstances under which we may disclose such information to third parties.

				Processing<br/>We will process your Personal Data legally and fairly and not use it outside the purposes of which we have informed you. So far as we are able we shall ensure that all of your Personal Data is accurate and up to date.

				Security of Your Personal Data<br/>We protect Personal Data with appropriate physical, technological and organizational safeguards and security measures.

As such we cannot give any warranty or assurance that the means where information is conveyed to us are safe, reliable or have integrity. We audit our procedures and security measures regularly to ensure they are being properly administered and remain effective and appropriate. Every member of WBCRYP is committed to our privacy policies and procedures to safeguard Personal Data. Our Application has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration of the information under our control. More specifically, our server uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) security protection by encrypting your Personal Data including credit card number, name and address to prevent individuals from reading these Data as it travels over the Internet. The length of time we retain Personal Data outside our back up system varies depending on the purpose for which it was collected and used.
